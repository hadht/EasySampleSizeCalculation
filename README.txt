Easy Sample Size Calculation

Easy Sample Size Calculation is a software for the calculation of sample size for several 
statistical techniques, such as estimation, hypothesis tests and linear models in several areas 
of knowledge. Easy Sample Size Calculation is a part of the Easy Sample Size Project (ESSP). 

The Easy Sample Size Project (ESSP), website link: <http://www.est.ufmg.br/~thiagords/ESSP.htm>, was born from a latent need of 
students, researchers and users 
of statistical techniques in their studies and sample surveys, who did not know how to determinate the size of their sample and 
the statistical techniques and computational tools available.
The ESSP aims to disseminate these statistical and computational techniques to the entire community. Produce and disseminate 
programs and/or functions for the sample size calculation.
The ESSP has purely pedagogical, academic and extension purposes, indicating materials, codes and softwares for 
calculating sample size for various statistical techniques.

We are fascinated by sample size calculation techniques!
